# ggml Optimization Configuration

## Tensor Shape Customization

The ggml Hybrid Persona Agent is designed for optimal performance with customizable tensor configurations:

### Memory Optimization
```typescript
// Default configuration optimized for cognitive expressivity
const MEMORY_CONFIG = {
  semantic_dim: 768,      // Prime factorization: 2^8 × 3
  context_depth: 512,     // Prime factorization: 2^9
  activation_level: 64    // Prime factorization: 2^6
};

// Low-memory configuration for resource-constrained environments
const MEMORY_CONFIG_LITE = {
  semantic_dim: 384,      // Prime factorization: 2^7 × 3
  context_depth: 256,     // Prime factorization: 2^8
  activation_level: 32    // Prime factorization: 2^5
};
```

### Task Orchestration Scaling
```typescript
// High-throughput configuration for complex orchestration
const TASK_CONFIG_ENHANCED = {
  intent_dim: 512,        // Prime factorization: 2^9
  action_space: 256,      // Prime factorization: 2^8
  orchestration_depth: 64 // Prime factorization: 2^6
};
```

### Catalog Integration Readiness

The persona agent architecture is designed for seamless integration with ggml model catalogs:

1. **Tensor Shape Compatibility**: All dimensions use prime factorizations for optimal mathematical properties
2. **Dynamic Scaling**: Tensor shapes can be adjusted based on available computational resources
3. **Modular Architecture**: Individual subsystems can be independently optimized or replaced
4. **Memory Efficiency**: RAG kernels support distributed embeddings for large-scale knowledge bases

### Performance Monitoring

Built-in ECAN feedback loops continuously monitor:
- Tensor operation efficiency
- Memory kernel activation patterns
- Spawning trigger frequencies
- Self-modification effectiveness

### Future Catalog Features

- Model versioning and rollback capabilities
- Distributed tensor computation across multiple nodes
- Automatic hyperparameter optimization based on usage patterns
- Integration with external ggml runtime environments
