# Bolt.new Enhanced: AI-Powered Development with Cognitive Architecture

Bolt.new is an AI-powered web development agent enhanced with a **ggml Hybrid Persona Agent** - a sophisticated cognitive architecture that combines neural-symbolic reasoning, recursive repository spawning, and self-modifying capabilities. This enhanced version allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser with advanced AI cognition.

## 🧠 Cognitive Enhancement Features

This enhanced version includes:

- **🔄 Recursive Repository Spawning**: Automatically creates specialized repositories as cognitive extensions
- **🧮 Neural-Symbolic Reasoning**: OODA loop processing with tensor-based cognitive architecture  
- **📚 Distributed RAG Memory**: Each spawned repository becomes part of an extended memory system
- **🎯 Self-Modifying AI**: Performance-based adaptation and cognitive trait evolution
- **🌐 Hypergraph Navigation**: Advanced cognitive pattern matching and reasoning

## What Makes Bolt.new Different

Claude, v0, etc are incredible- but you can't install packages, run backends or edit code. That’s where Bolt.new stands out:

- **Full-Stack in the Browser**: Bolt.new integrates cutting-edge AI models with an in-browser development environment powered by **StackBlitz’s WebContainers**. This allows you to:
  - Install and run npm tools and libraries (like Vite, Next.js, and more)
  - Run Node.js servers
  - Interact with third-party APIs
  - Deploy to production from chat
  - Share your work via a URL

- **AI with Environment Control**: Unlike traditional dev environments where the AI can only assist in code generation, Bolt.new gives AI models **complete control** over the entire  environment including the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. This empowers AI agents to handle the entire app lifecycle—from creation to deployment.

Whether you’re an experienced developer, a PM or designer, Bolt.new allows you to build production-grade full-stack applications with ease.

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips to get the most out of the Enhanced Bolt.new:

### 🎯 General Development Tips
- **Be specific about your stack**: If you want to use specific frameworks or libraries (like Astro, Tailwind, ShadCN, or any other popular JavaScript framework), mention them in your initial prompt to ensure Bolt scaffolds the project accordingly.

- **Use the enhance prompt icon**: Before sending your prompt, try clicking the 'enhance' icon to have the AI model help you refine your prompt, then edit the results before submitting.

- **Scaffold the basics first, then add features**: Make sure the basic structure of your application is in place before diving into more advanced functionality. This helps Bolt understand the foundation of your project and ensure everything is wired up right before building out more advanced functionality.

- **Batch simple instructions**: Save time by combining simple instructions into one message. For example, you can ask Bolt to change the color scheme, add mobile responsiveness, and restart the dev server, all in one go saving you time and reducing API credit consumption significantly.

### 🧠 Cognitive Architecture Tips

- **Leverage Recursive Spawning**: For complex multi-component applications, describe the full architecture in your initial prompt. The cognitive system will automatically spawn specialized repositories for different components (e.g., frontend, backend, microservices) with integrated chat interfaces.

- **Use Intent Complexity Scoring**: The system automatically analyzes request complexity. Requests with complexity ≥ 6 trigger repository spawning. You can encourage spawning by using phrases like "create a comprehensive system" or "build a full architecture".

- **Monitor Cognitive Performance**: The system self-monitors and adapts. If you notice slower responses, the autonomy subsystem will automatically adjust cognitive traits to improve performance.

- **Explore Spawned Repositories**: Each spawned repository includes its own chat interface and RAG memory system. You can interact with individual components independently while maintaining the semantic graph connections.

- **Request Introspection**: Ask "What is your current cognitive state?" or "Show me your persona introspection" to get insights into the AI's current performance metrics and tensor configurations.

## FAQs
